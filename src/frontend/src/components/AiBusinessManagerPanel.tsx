    "Top 3 actions for maximum agency impact this week: restart the review cadence for inactive clients, update business hours on all Google listings before the weekend, and review the fundability scores for clients approaching loan readiness.",
  ],
  fundability: [
    "Agency-wide fundability snapshot: 2 clients are 'Growth Ready' (75+), 3 are 'In Progress' (50–74), and 1 is 'Foundation Stage' (below 50). The fastest path to improvement for the bottom client is opening a dedicated business checking account and securing a DUNS number.",
    "Fundability is your strongest upsell path. Clients who hit 75+ become eligible for $50K–$250K in business credit — and they attribute that milestone directly to your platform. Push the 3 'In Progress' clients with a targeted outreach this week.",

    "Focus area this week: fundability. You're 7 points away from the 75/100 threshold that unlocks business credit access. The fastest path: open a business credit card and use it for one recurring expense. That single action typically adds 8–12 points.",
